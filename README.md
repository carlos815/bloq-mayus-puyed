# Download

Download the zip [here](https://github.com/carlos815/bloq-mayus-puyed/releases/tag/publish), decompress and run the "Bloq Mayus Puyed.exe" file.

Everyone has different needs, I highly encourage you to install Autohotkeys and modify the files to your heart's content :)

Note: switching audio devices (Caps Lock + J) requires aditional set up. You need to install AudioDeviceCmdlets in PowerShell for it to work. (its [easy](https://github.com/frgnca/AudioDeviceCmdlets))
